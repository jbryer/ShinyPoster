The figure below shows the relationship between miles per gallon (`mpg`), weight (`wt`), and number of cylinders (`cyl`). We estimated the following linear regression:

$$Y_{mpg} = \beta_{wt} + \beta_{cyl} + \beta_{0}$$

and the results are provided below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
lm(mpg ~ wt + cyl, data = mtcars)
```
